Sanity Check (Aymen) - Code in discord server

Er Titus (Aymen) - Picture of a guy in an airport. I reversed image searched it using tineye, found a lot of railway results. The description made it sound like an airport, so after seeing what's connected to the railway I got the airports name.

All others, like online python editor, were unable to be solved during the 24 hours.
